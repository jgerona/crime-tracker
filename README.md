# Crime Tracker
Crime Tracker, helping you stay informed about crime rates in your area.

## Description
Crime Tracker allows you to see the crime ratings of your area. After searching your city in the search bar, Crime Tracker will return ratings for violent crime, property crime, and overall crime. It will also populate six nearby zipcodes and their crime ratings. These are portrayed as Alphabet characters: A, B, C, D, or F. Rating A represents highest crime rates and rating F represents low crime.

To build this application, we used:
- Bulma
- Crime Data by ZipCode API (https://rapidapi.com/zyla-labs-zyla-labs-default/api/crime-data-by-zipcode-api)
